# Budget Manager Ideas

1. **Print-on-Demand Production**
   - Use a print-to-order model to avoid inventory costs and waste.
   - *Rationale*: Only make pots as ordered, minimizing surplus and maximizing cash flow.

2. **Bulk Material Sourcing**
   - Negotiate bulk purchases of filament and other raw materials to reduce per-unit costs.
   - *Rationale*: Larger lots yield steep discounts and more predictable margins.

3. **Direct-to-Consumer Sales Model**
   - Prioritize direct online sales—through a web shop or platforms like Etsy—to minimize retail margin cuts.
   - *Rationale*: Higher profit margins, lower operational overhead, flexible pricing.
